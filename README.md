# SecurityCenterScripts
These scripts came about from a need to get around some limitations within SecurityCenter as well as to help meet regulatory compliance (PCI DSS, HIPAA, NERC-CIP, etc.)

## Acknowledgements
First and foremost, my loving wife and family who have tolerated my long hours and late nights working.

Second, I want to give a shout out to Steve McGrath for his work on the [pySecurityCenter](https://github.com/SteveMcGrath/pySecurityCenter) Python module without which the scripts I am providing here would not be possible.

Third, kudos out to the great people at Tenable for creating such an awesome suite of products.

## About Me
I am by no way an expert programmer, so my scripts may look messy to many but hey... they get the job done.
