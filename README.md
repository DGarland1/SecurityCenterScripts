# SecurityCenterScripts
These scripts came about from a need to get around some limitations within SecurityCenter as well as to help meet regulatory compliance (PCI DSS, HIPAA, NERC-CIP, etc.)

## Requirements
For the scripts in the folders (ie. RiskRules) you'll also need the pyCommon.py and pyLogging.py files as well.  Just copy the directory structure from Github.

Also, you'll need the following Python modules installed by downloading them manually or using pip to install
    
[pySecurityCenter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pySecurityCenter)

[dicttoxml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dicttoxml)

[configparser](https://pypi.org/project/configparser)

## Acknowledgements
First and foremost, my loving wife and family who have tolerated my long hours and late nights working.

Second, I want to give a shout out to Steve McGrath for his work on the [pySecurityCenter](https://github.com/SteveMcGrath/pySecurityCenter) Python module.  Also, a shout out to Ryan McGreal over at [QuandyFactory](https://quandyfactory.com/) for his [dicttoxml](https://github.com/quandyfactory/dicttoxml) python module.  As well as to many other great individuals who have contributed to the development of Python and Python modules.  None of which the scripts I am providing here would not be possible.

Third, kudos out to the great people at Tenable for creating such an awesome suite of products.

## About Me
I am by no way an expert programmer, so my scripts may look messy to many but hey... they get the job done.
